## Introduction

With the rise of UPI transactions, managing and tracking expenses has become more crucial. This project aims to leverage the small note field available during transactions to group and organize spending. By adding relevant notes, users can easily see where their money is going and make informed financial decisions.

## Project Idea
In today's digital age, UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions have become an integral part of our daily lives. Popular apps like Google Pay, Paytm, and PayPal allow users to make instant payments with ease. A small but often overlooked feature in these transactions is the ability to add a note or description while making a payment. This note not only helps in personalizing the transaction but also reflects in the user's bank statement or passbook, providing a brief context for the transaction.

## The Problem
Managing and categorizing expenses can be a daunting task, especially when transactions pile up over time. While many people use spreadsheets or third-party apps to track their spending, these methods often require manual entry and can be time-consuming.

## The Solution
Bank Statement/Transaction Manager is a tool that capitalizes on the notes added during UPI transactions. By using these notes, the tool automatically groups and organizes transactions, allowing users to track their expenses with minimal effort. For instance, if you consistently add the note "grocery" while purchasing groceries, the tool will categorize these transactions under "Grocery." At the end of the month, you can easily see how much you've spent on groceries, making budgeting and financial planning more straightforward.

## Why This Matters
This tool is particularly useful for individuals who want to maintain a clear record of their spending habits without having to manually categorize each transaction. It also provides a seamless way to review and analyze expenses, helping users make informed decisions about their finances.

## Features

- Transaction Grouping: Automatically group transactions based on user-added notes.
- Expense Tracking: Track and analyze spending in different categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, etc.).
- Monthly Reports: Generate monthly spending reports based on grouped transactions.
